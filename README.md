# My Guided Projects Repository
This repository contains all the projects that I completed under someone's guidance. These projects are solely intended to improve specific tool skills by practicing them, and implementing them with imaginary/real datasets.

Note : *The datasets provided here are provided by other people **solely for educational purpose.***

### Structure of the repository
This repo has folders for all projects, each providing the dataset and the analytics implementation. Descriptions are provided for each project in their own READMEs.
