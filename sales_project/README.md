# AtliQ Hardware Sales Analysis

This was my first ever data analytics project, guided by @codebasics. It's about sales data analysis of an imaginary hardware store, known as ***AtliQ Hardware.*** AtliQ has brick and mortar stores in many major Indian cities, and their sales director wants to know the overall sales performance of the store, without dealing with lots of excel files.
